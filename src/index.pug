        h1 Introduction to Linguistic Data Science
        h2 John P. McCrae - University of Galway
        h3 Abstract
        p Big data is fundamentally changing the way that linguists can investigate linguistic facts leading to a new research area which combines data science with linguistics. This course provides an introduction to the new area of linguistic data science by means of an introductory course with hands-on data analysis that is focused on key questions in linguistics. This course will first provide a basic introduction to data science and in particular how this can be applied to large corpora using natural language processing techniques. We will then show how this can be used to find answers to problems in syntax, semantics, multilinguality and other areas of linguistics, along with a summary giving perspectives on how these methods can be applied to students' own research.
        h3 Motivation and description 
        p Big data and new computational methods are fundamentally changing approaches to linguistics. The existence of large corpora and powerful methods for analysing these corpora has made corpus linguistics a key approach to tackling challenges across linguistics. Further, recent developments in natural language processing are enabling more complex questions related to syntax, semantics and language usage to be answered that cannot be achieved with simple counting based approaches. In this course, we will introduce students to the main methods and approaches used in linguistic data science. This course is structured as five short lectures with hands-on exercises that allow students to engage with and work directly on large corpus, by means of iPython notebooks. This course will present data analysis skills including data visualisation in order to understand complex linguistic questions.
        p The course will first provide a basic introduction to the use of data science techniques, through the use of iPython notebooks. This will cover the basics of working with text corpora including tokenization, normalisation and part-of-speech tagging. We will show how we can load a large corpus and we will use this to investigate some basic questions about this corpus. We will also cover basic data visualisation techniques in order to understand the output of systems. The final 30 minutes of the lecture will focus on a hands-on question, and for this lecture we will look at how we can use word frequency analysis in order to identify the authors of texts based on frequency counts.
        p The second lecture will focus on the use of corpora in order to answer questions about syntax in text. We will look at how we can parse texts in order to reveal the syntactic structure of the text and how we can apply morphological analysis in order to analyse the inflectional and derivational morphology of text. We will see how this can be combined to answer more complex questions about the usage of language. For the hands-on section, we will look at the question of morphology learning and see if we can find inflectional rules from unannotated text using statistical methods.
        p The third lecture will focus on the use of word embeddings and large language models in order to answer questions about semantics. We will provide a brief introduction to these models and then show how to work with these models in particular making use of GloVe vectors and the BERT model. The main question for these lectures will be how we can use data science techniques in order to analyse word senses and infer if there are multiple senses. This will be achieved by means of visualisation of the semantic vector space of the word.
        p The fourth lecture is focused on multilingual linguistic data science, focusing particularly on the use of machine translation and parallel corpora as resources to enable multilingual analysis of data. We will briefly look at how we can handle texts in mixtures of languages, especially code-mixed texts and use language identification to distinguish texts. We will also look at the evaluation of machine translation, its challenges and methods for post-editing translation. For the hands-on section we will construct a simple machine translation system and use this to analyse the translation of a text. For the hands-on, we will look at the basics of training and using a machine translation system and how this can be applied to a multilingual text.
        p The final lecture will cover perspectives on linguistic data science, including several areas where a data science approach can be applied to linguistic questions in discourse.  We will look at how we can use these techniques for analysing social media and look at how we can analyse rhetorical devices, such as irony and sarcasm in text. We will then turn to the analysis of novels by means of narrative analysis and finally look at how we can analyse many texts in a diachronic fashion in order to extract trends in the text. The hands-on for this session will look at the analysis of sarcasm and how we can use these techniques in order to detect and quantify these elements.
        p Overall this course will provide a broad overview of how data science techniques, including machine learning, natural language processing and data visualisation can be applied to linguistics and will equip students with powerful tools to analyse their own challenges in a quantitative manner.

        h3 Expected level and prerequisites
        p This course is aimed at PhD students engaged in linguistics, computer science or a related field. The course will illustrate key concepts using Python, however we do not expect students to have any prior experience with programming, as students will be provided with iPython notebooks and will only be expected to make minor changes in order to complete their investigations. Although we will cover some technical concepts, we do not expect any prerequisites in terms of mathematics, computer science or linguistics. As such, we expect that this course will be accessible to all students at ESSLLI. I note that this course will be partly based on a similar course, “Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing for Managers”, offered as part of a postgraduate diploma at the University of Galway.
